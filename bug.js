The Firebase Realtime Database client sometimes throws an error when trying to read data that has been recently written or updated.  This is particularly noticeable when dealing with transactions or multi-path updates. The error message might be vague or non-descriptive, such as a generic network error or a timeout. The data is eventually consistent, so the data does appear after a few retries, but it leads to a bad user experience.  This is often due to the asynchronous nature of Firebase and the time it takes for data to propagate across the database.
