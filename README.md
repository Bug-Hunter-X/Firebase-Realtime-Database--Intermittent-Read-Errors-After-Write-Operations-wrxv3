This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in Firebase Realtime Database.  The issue arises when reading data immediately after writing or updating it.  While Firebase is eventually consistent, there's a window where reads can fail, even though the data exists. This repository provides code examples showing the problem and a solution involving appropriate error handling and retry mechanisms.  The problem usually manifests as seemingly random read errors, particularly when using transactions or updating multiple paths simultaneously. The solution uses exponential backoff retries to help mitigate the issue.
